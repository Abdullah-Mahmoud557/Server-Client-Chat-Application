# TCP Server-Client-Chat-Application
This project is a simple chat application using TCP, developed in Java. It allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and exchange messages in real-time. The server manages each client in a separate thread, ensuring smooth communication. When a client sends a message, the server receives it and relays it to all other connected clients.

Technologies Used
Java: Used to implement both the server and client.
TCP/IP: Ensures reliable communication between the server and clients.
Sockets: Javaâ€™s Socket and ServerSocket classes handle network connections and data exchange.
